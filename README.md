# PCgamesWebsite
This is my last project that i created for school back in 12th grade.
Unfortunately the version I found did not have the catalogue page finished, although if I manage to find the full site I'll upload it.
In here i've used a variety of HTML/CSS and multiple occasions of OOP. The whole project I made from scratch, Including classes and logos.

Everything was created in Adobe Dreamweaver.

!!! THE COMPANY IN THE WEBSITE DOES NOT EXIST !!!
